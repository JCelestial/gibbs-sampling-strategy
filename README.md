# Gibbs Style LLM Sampler

A study conducted on the exploration of bridging concepts in Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics within the application of sampling strategies done during LLM decoding.

The study is currently in progress and I will update it along the way.

This is a [marimo](https://docs.marimo.io/) notebook, so you won't see any `.ipynb` files as marimo stores these as pure python. Click on the link if you want to know more about marimo.

### Quickstart
Clone the repo and create a virtual environment
```python
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the venv (command is OS dependent) and run
```python
pip install marimo
```

To launch the notebook server, run
```python
marimo edit
```
